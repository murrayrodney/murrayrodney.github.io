      location: Anchorage, Alaska
      overview: An independent oil and gas operator
    positions:
      - designation: Data Analytics Engineer
        start: Jun 2020
        responsibilities:
          - Frame and develop a deep learning model for production forecasting
          - Utilize analytical reservoir models and reinforcement learning to optimize production and injection
          - Apply statistical methods to uncertainty in well test metering to quantify value of reducing metering error
          - Forecast failures of injection wells through the use of survival analysis techniques
      - designation: Voidage Management Coordinator
        start: Jan 2019
        end: Jun 2020
        responsibilities:
          - Optimize fieldwide production and injection systems for the Greater Kuparuk Area (GKA) to optimize recover with waterflooding and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes
          - Develop a novel integrated production and injection network which utilized machine learning methods in place of multiphase hydraulics correlations and genetic algorithms for optimization of well settings
          - Provide input on pattern maturity and field constraints to development teams for infill drilling decisions
      - designation: Reservoir Engineer
        start: Oct 2016
        end: Dec 2018
        responsibilities:
          - Work with base production and development teams to optimize recovery for existing and infill wells in the Central Production Facility 3 (CPF3) area of GKA
          - Begin development of an integrated production and injection network for GKA
          - Forecast production for reserves analysis
      - designation: Drillsite Petroleum Engineer
        start: July 2014
        end: Oct 2016
        responsibilities:
          - Oversee production and injection activities for >100 wells over 5 drillsites in GKA
          - Utilize reservoir simulation to help provide estimates for fieldwide injection impacts
          - Analyzed type pattern and full field reservoir model resutls to optimize selection of current and future EOR targets
