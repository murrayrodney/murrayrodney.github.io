summary: I am a data scientist who started off as a petroleum engineer in Alaska after graduating from the University of Wyoming with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After working as an engineer for several years I discovered my love for working with data problems which lead me to a data science based role (Data Analytics Engineer in our company). After several months of working in that position and recognizing an opportunity to build a better foundation in statistics I began the Master of Applied Statistics program from Colorado State University.
